# Project Instructions
**Review the Article to Mockup Project Rubric**

Download and unzip `mockup-to-article.zip` in the Supporting Materials section, below. You'll find `index.html`, the article mockup image (`blog-mockup.pdf`) and a file called `reflections.txt` inside.

Use what you've learned about web development so far to edit index.html so that it looks exactly like the mockup image. You will need to use new elements, which means that you'll need to research and experiment! (Hint: look up "superscript," "horizontal rule," and "strikethrough."). 

:point_right: Note: You can recreate the mockup without using a single \<br\> tag! You don't need to worry about line breaks. 
The text should naturally wrap depending on how wide the window is.

When you've finished building the article, open up reflections.txt. You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development in `reflections.txt`. Answer the following questions:

> _What new skills have you learned?_\
> _What has been easy?_\
> _What has been difficult?_\
> _How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?_
